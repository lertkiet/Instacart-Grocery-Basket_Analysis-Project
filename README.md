# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Project
## Project Summary

This repository presents a Python-based analysis of Instacart's Grocery Basket data, designed to answer key questions posed by Instacart stakeholders. The goal is to identify customer segments that can be targeted with tailored marketing campaigns to assess their impact on product sales.
The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns in customer purchasing behaviors. Several factors, including age, region, number of dependents, and family status, are explored to understand how they influence Instacart's revenue. These insights will enable Instacart to refine its marketing strategies, ensuring they effectively reach and engage the right customer profiles, ultimately boosting product sales.

##  Overview and Objective of Instacart

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. We need perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions

1. The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
2. They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
5. What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
6. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
7. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
8. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
9. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
10. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?

## Data Used for this Analysis

1. Customers
2. Orders
